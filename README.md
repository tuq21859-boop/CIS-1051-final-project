# CIS-1051-final-project

Rough Draft of what we said in the Video 

Introduction: Hi our names are Salina (Chemistry Major) and Sophia (Biology Major) and we are sophomores, for the final project we created a heart rate monitor.

Importance - stem students interested in healthcare so we wanted to use this opportunity to integrate what we've learned this semester to our interest. A heart rate monitor is important because it is able to detect real-time data on heart activity which can inform the user of their heart functionality immediately.

Challenges that we faced: In the beginning we had planned to make a 3D printed case for our project, but with the equipments we had access to it didn't manage to fit in our case, so we decided to forgo that idea. We also had trouble with the hardware portion. We had to connect the wires properly which took a lot of trial and error, in order to ensure that the sensor would pick up the signals to show on our display panel, which took a lot of time. We also had to learn how to solder which we included a video of Salina soldering.

For the software aspect of our project, we had to learn how to code in C++ which was one of the most difficult parts of this project. We had to get some help from our freind, who taught us the syntax used in C++. From then forward, it was just a lot of debugging with the code and just seeing what parameter our system was capable of performing at. We also had to to learn how to use Aurdino IDE which was where we wrote all of our code, and how we got our hardware to connect to the sensor and the display panel. 

For some additonal fun machinery aspect of our project, we added a potentiometer which allows us to adjust the brightness of our display panel which was fun. We also added an additional light which will light up red everytime someone's heart rate went above 120 bpm and we also added a resistor so the brightness will be lower by half so our circuits don't get fried.
