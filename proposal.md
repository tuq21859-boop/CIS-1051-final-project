# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pulse Oximeter 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

- Our project aims to create a pulse oximeter which can be used to measure your heart rate and your SPO2(blood oxygen) levels. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our project aims to create a portable oximeter that incorporates building both the  hardware and software aspect of the monitor. The monitor should measure the user's pulse and blood oxygen level in a quick and simple fashion by using a sensor that emits light into the user's fingertip. The light is captured by the photodetector and the sensor will determine the user's pulse and SPO2 levels which will be displayed nicely for the user to see via a digital screen. The montor should clipped onto the user's finger without creating any discomfort. To make the oximeter, we will first use 3D printing to make the outer shell, built the hardware portion, and then implement the software to ensure that it is a working gadget. 

Sophia as a pre-med and Salina as a Chemistry are both very interested in making healthcare more acessible. Thus, we were inspired by the simple yet highly effective mechanism of the oximeter in measuring a patient's pulse and SPO2 level. These type of monitors are widely used to quickly measure a patient's vital and thus, increases the patient-flow in a busy healthcare environment. Through this project, we wish to learn how a pulse oximeter work from start to finsh and hope to understand how modern technology improves healthcare.  

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
Group of 2 --> Member Names:
- Salina Zhang: Tuq21859@temple.edu, TA: David Loder 
- Sophia Sun: Tus42704@temple.edu, TA: Farnoush Nilizadeh 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Creating the physical shell of the monitor via 3-d printing through Temple
- Connecting the pulse oximeter, arduino nano, and cables to the physical shell of monitor (although might not be working properly)
- Some portion of the code is written/attempting to write the code

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Successfully getting the hardware together (the monitor itself) with working circuits
- Getting the sensor to work (maybe not properly) and getting the digital screen to work

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Everything work correctly: both software (coding) and hardward wise
- The oximeter is able to correctly display user's heartrate and SPO2 level on the screen

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We would have to first determine what materials we would need to purchase, and what materials we have access to through the Maker’s Studio at Temple. We would have to learn how to use the 3-d printer and make a design for physical monitor. We would also have to learn about the circuits and wires that are required for the light sensor in the monitor to work successfully. We would have to either learn C++ or change the applicable code from C++ to python for our usage. We would have to research a little more about how Arduino works, because we are using the Arduino platform in order to create our monitor. We plan on working together throughout this whole process.
