#### What have you done for your project so far?

We brought all of the equipments needed for the project and booked a time for Temple's Makerspace studio to build our hardward portion during break. We have the CAD file for the outer case of the pulse oximeter and we have already booked a time to use the 3D printing machines at Temple. Talked to a friend who is a ECE major and asked for help about the hardware and coding portion of the project.
