Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We brought all of the equipments needed for the project and booked a time for Temple's Makerspace studio to build our hardward portion during break. We have the CAD file for the outer case of the pulse oximeter and we have already booked a time to use the 3D printing machines at Temple. Talked to a friend who is an ECE major and asked for help about the overall hardware and coding portion of the project. He was able to give our feedback about what next steps we should take for our project. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

For the project, we have the CAD file for the outer case of the pulse oximeter but we still need to print it at the Makerspace which we have an appointment made. We still need to assemble the circuits and the wires and the overall hardware, and connect it to its case. We also need to edit the code provided in order to have it better fit for our project, and determine the factors that we want the screen to display, ie. frequency, heart rate, etc. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

None so far.
