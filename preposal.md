## Do you have any questions of your own?

- Our project ideas seem to not include a lot of coding, would that be okay?
- Which one do you think would be the best for us to make? Do you think any of them is too hard?
- We have to buy materials for this project, do you recommendations for where to purchase these materials?
- We're feeling kind of ambious. If we have extra time, can we make two projects?
